I've made a folder for each of you to add your code to.

Nick -> Graphing


Matt -> Wearable Services


Andrew -> Connectivity Services


There is a file in your folders called "test.txt". This is because folders in a repository need to always have at least one file stored 
in them. Once you guys have added your first file, please delete test.txt.
